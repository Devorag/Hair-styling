# Hair-styling
I would like a clear organized list of all my clients for hair or wig styling. I believe the first step is to have data. I therefore seek to record all the clients inside a database table.

## Spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called spec.txt

## Deliverables
The 3 files listed below are required to implement the requirements for this repo. The info for each one is in the spec. 
1. table.sql (create database and table)
2. sample data.sql
3. reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
- primary key
- properly named columns
- proper data types
- not null as appropriate
- constraints
- files should be able to run repeatedly to include drop and use statements.
